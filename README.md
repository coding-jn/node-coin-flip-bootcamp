## How It's Made
The application uses the fs and http modules, more specifically the http creates the server and fs reads the html file. Because this was a simple program I was able to include Vanilla ES6 JS in it to save time spent writing code and to condense the information sent to the user.

## What I Learned
This was my first application using Vanilla ES6 JS so it was interesting to learn more about the different types of JS and its technicalities. Overall, this program was just great practice for Node.
